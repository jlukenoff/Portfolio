    As an experienced software engineer, I am driven by my passion for
    problem-solving and technology. I specialize in full-stack TypeScript, with
    expertise in Node.js and React, as well as robust experience in Python,
    Golang, Java, and Scala. My ability to design, develop, deploy, and maintain
    robust and performant software has been honed through years of experience
    building cutting-edge applications. testing testing

    After moving to the Bay Area in 2014 from a small town in Indiana, I
    fulfilled my dream of starting a business at the age of 21 with Lukenoff
    Associates. I built the business by gathering a full force of clients and
    traveling around the Bay Area to provide home remodeling and repair
    services.

    Eventually, I decided to switch careers and enter the world of tech in
    Silicon Valley. I spent six months learning the basics of programming and
    was accepted to one of the top software engineering bootcamps in the Bay
    Area, Hack Reactor. Upon completion of Hack Reactor, I landed my first job
    as an engineer at Narvar, where I collaborated with enterprise and
    commercial e-commerce brands to implement solutions that simplify the lives
    of everyday consumers.

    Currently, I am working at Asana, where I am focused on enabling and scaling
    the Enterprise Data platform. This role has allowed me to gain more
    experience in backend and infrastructure development and continue my journey
    as a software engineer. With my years of experience in the industry and my
    passion for delivering top-notch solutions, I am always excited to take on
    new challenges and help businesses achieve their goals.
