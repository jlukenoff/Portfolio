    I am the Tech Lead for Logging and Experiments at Asana, where I focus on
    building observability and experimentation platforms that empower Data
    Science and R&D teams to make data-driven decisions at scale. My work
    ensures that Asana's engineering and product teams have the tools to
    measure, analyze, and iterate efficiently, helping drive innovation across
    the company.
    <br />
    <br />
    With a strong background in full-stack TypeScript (Node.js, React) and
    experience in Python, Golang, Java, and Scala, I specialize in designing and
    maintaining scalable backend systems, high-performance logging pipelines,
    and experimentation frameworks. My passion lies in building reliable and
    performant infrastructure that enables teams to extract insights, experiment
    rapidly, and optimize user experiences.
    <br />
    <br />
    My journey into tech was unconventional. After moving to the Bay Area in
    2014 from a small town in Indiana, I pursued my entrepreneurial ambitions by
    founding Lukenoff Associates, a home remodeling and repair business.
    Eventually, my passion for technology led me to switch careers. I spent six
    months immersing myself in programming, earned a spot at Hack Reactor, and
    landed my first engineering role at Narvar, where I worked on e-commerce
    solutions for enterprise brands.
    <br />
    <br />
    Now at Asana, I continue to push the boundaries of observability,
    experimentation, and data-driven engineering, ensuring that teams have the
    insights they need to build better products. Iâ€™m always eager to take on new
    challenges, optimize systems, and help businesses scale with confidence.
